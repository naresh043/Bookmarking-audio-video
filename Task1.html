        <p>Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, India, was a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. His life story is an inspiring tale of spiritual quest, intellectual prowess, and dedicated service to humanity. Here is a brief chapter-wise account of his life:</p>
        <h2 id="chap1">Chapter 1: Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>Narendranath Datta was born into an aristocratic Bengali family. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney with a strong influence on Narendranath's intellectual development, while his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, shaped his spiritual outlook. Narendranath was a precocious child, showing a keen interest in spirituality and philosophy. He excelled in his studies at school and later at the General Assembly’s Institution (now Scottish Church College), where he immersed himself in a wide range of subjects, including Western philosophy, history, and science.</p>

        <h2 id="chap2">Chapter 2: Spiritual Quest and Meeting Ramakrishna</h2>
        <p>Narendranath’s spiritual journey intensified during his college years. He sought answers to existential questions and was deeply influenced by the teachings of Brahmo Samaj. His quest led him to meet the mystic saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa at Dakshineswar. Initially skeptical, Narendranath was eventually drawn to Ramakrishna’s simplicity, spiritual depth, and profound experiences of God. Under Ramakrishna’s guidance, Narendranath underwent a transformative spiritual experience, finding answers to his deepest questions.</p>
